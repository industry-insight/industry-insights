<p>On February 2023, AGC and Saint-Gobain, two of the world's leading flat glass manufacturers in terms of sustainability, have announced a collaboration on the design of a pilot breakthrough flat glass line that is predicted to considerably cut direct CO2 emissions. As part of this R&amp;D project, AGC's patterned glass manufacturing line in Barevka, Czech Republic, will be completely renovated into a high-performing, cutting-edge line that will be 50% electrified and 50% fueled by a combination of oxygen and gas. This is a technological breakthrough when compared to current technology utilized in natural gas-fired flat glass furnaces. It will be the most environmentally friendly flat glass line design, contributing to both firms' pathways to carbon neutrality and the essential acceleration of the flat glass industry's decarbonization.</p>
